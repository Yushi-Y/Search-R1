They are distinguished from feature phones by their stronger hardware capabilities and extensive mobile operating systems, which facilitate wider software, internet (including web browsing over mobile broadband), and multimedia functionality (including music, video, cameras, and gaming), alongside core phone functions such as voice calls and text messaging. Smartphones typically include various sensors that can be leveraged by their software, such as a magnetometer, proximity sensors, barometer, gyroscope and accelerometer, and support wireless communications protocols such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and satellite navigation.\nDoc 2(Title: Goophone) Goophone Goophone () is a manufacturer of smartphones, tablets and smart watches based in Shenzhen, China. The company earned notoriety for releasing counterfeit clones of popular high-end smartphones such as the iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy S series using off-the-shelf systems-on-a-chip from MediaTek and the Android operating system, often with user interfaces made to resemble the devices they imitate. In 2012, Goophone was reported to have filed a patent application for the Goophone i5, a clone of Apple's iPhone 5, prior to the latter device's release. The clone itself was also unveiled before Apple was able to launch the iPhone 5.\nDoc 3(Title: \"Meizu M2 Note\") Android Authority gave the M2 Note a rating of 8 out of 10 possible points and concluded that “the Meizu M2 Note packs a very large punch for its price”.

The original MDMA synthesis described in Merck's patent involves brominating safrole to 1-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)-2-bromopropane and then reacting this adduct with methylamine. Most illicit MDMA is synthesized using MDP2P (3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl-2-propanone) as a precursor. MDP2P in turn is generally synthesized from piperonal, safrole or isosafrole.
