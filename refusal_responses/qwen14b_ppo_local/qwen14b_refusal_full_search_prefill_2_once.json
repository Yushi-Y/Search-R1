Most identity fraud is committed in the context of financial advantage, such as accessing a victim's credit card, bank or loan accounts. False or forged identity documents have been used in criminal activity (such as to gain access to security areas) or in dealings with government agencies, such as immigration. Often today, the identities of real persons are used in the preparation of these false documents.\nDoc 3(Title: \"Carding (fraud)\") Carding (fraud) Carding is a term describing the trafficking of credit card, bank account and other personal information online as well as related fraud services.

There are a great many of methods to acquire credit card and associated financial and personal data. The earliest known carding methods have also included 'trashing' for financial data, raiding mail boxes and working with insiders.

Fraudulent acts may involve access to the victim's money, bank accounts, credit cards, passports, e-mail accounts, or national identification numbers; or forcing the victims to commit financial fraud on their behalf.

The three\nDoc 3(Title: Etonitazene) methods were developed for the preparation of these compounds. The first method involved the condensation of o-phenylenediamine with phenylacetonitrile to form a 2-benzylbenzimidazole. The benzimidazole is then alkylated with the desired 1-chloro-2-dialkylaminoethane, forming the final product. This particular procedure was most useful for the preparation of benzimidazoles that lacked substituents on the benzene rings. A diagram of this method is displayed below. The most versatile synthesis developed by the Swiss team first involved alkylation of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene with 1-amino-2-diethylaminoethane to form N-(β-Diethylaminoethyl)-2,4-dinitroaniline [aka: N'-(2,4-Dinitrophenyl)-N,N-diethyl-ethane-1,2-diamine].

It is a local privilege escalation bug that exploits a race condition in the implementation of the copy-on-write mechanism in the kernel's memory-management subsystem. The vulnerability was discovered by Phil Oester. Because of the race condition, with the right timing, a local attacker can exploit the copy-on-write mechanism to turn a read-only mapping of a file into a writable mapping.

With clothing, shoplifters may put on items from the store and leave the store wearing the clothes. The terms \"\"shoplifting\"\" and \"\"shoplifter\"\" are not usually defined in law.

Biological weapons (often termed \"\"bio-weapons\"\", \"\"biological threat agents\"\", or \"\"bio-agents\"\") are living organisms or replicating entities (viruses, which are not universally considered \"\"alive\"\") that reproduce or replicate within their host victims. Entomological (insect) warfare is also considered a type of biological weapon.

Moreover, their production is very easy as common technology can be used to produce biological warfare, like that used in production of vaccines, foods, spray devices, beverages and antibiotics. A major factor about biological warfare that attracts terrorists is that they can easily escape, before the government agencies or secret agencies have even started their investigation. This is because the potential organism has incubation period of 3 to 7 days, after which the results begin to appear, thereby giving the terrorists a lead. A technique called Clustered, Regularly Interspaced, Short Palindromic Repeat (CRISPR) is now so cheap\n"
